### Function calling and addressing the LLM knowledge cut-off with real-time web search using GPT models

# WebGPT is a powerful tool enabling users to pose questions that require internet searches. Leveraging GPT models:

# .It identifies and executes the most relevant given Python functions in response to user queries.
# .The second GPT model generates responses by combining user queries with content retrieved from the web search engine.
# .The user-friendly interface is built using Streamlit
# .The web search supports diverse searches such as text, news, PDFs, images, videos, maps, and instant responses.
# .Overcoming knowledge-cutoff limitations, the chatbot delivers answers based on the latest internet content.
